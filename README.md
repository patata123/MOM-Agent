# AI Agents Demo â€“ MOM Statistics Scraper

This project showcases how multiple AI Agents can collaborate to automate the retrieval of statistical data from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) website.  
Instead of manually navigating pages and downloading files, the agents handle the heavy lifting:  
- Selecting the correct statistical table  
- Scraping the page  
- Finding the correct Excel file  
- Downloading it locally
